HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT COmbined

<button>Subscribe</button>
in CSS  
    button{} --> is called as Css Selectors
                here we can apply style and change the appearance
                This  will effective for all the buttons inside the page.

    To apply specifically for a button or buttons we can use id and class Selectors

we cam have multiple class names for an element. They can differenciate by giving space between them.
eg : <button class="js-Subscribe-btn Subscribe-btn" >Subscribe</button>
    here 2 classes js-Subscribe-btn and Subscribe-btn where seperated by space between them
    for class we can apply Css seelctor by giving as 
        .Subscribe-btn{}

.subscribe-btn{
            border: none; --> property-value pair
        }

Like innerText,innerHTML , we have an attribute in JS called classList
    classList -> gives us control over the class attribute

    when we click the button, add a class, this class will have different styles

    For classList() we have properties and values
        1.add()  -> adds class to the (list of) classes that we given in the html tag
            so we can style that class in css, when the class get added to the list then
            only the class name will added to the clases in the html tags

        2.remove()  -> removes class from the list


        example:-

            <button onclick="change()" class="js-subscribe-btn subscribe-btn">Subscribe</button>

            if(btn.innerText === 'Subscribe'){
                btn.innerText = 'Subscribed';
                btn.classList.add('is-subscribed')
            }
            else{
                btn.innerText = 'Subscribe';
                btn.classList.remove('is-subscribed');
            }

    These newly added css via class name will overrides the already existing once
rgb(,,) --> RGB --> red- green- blue
    each color will from 0 - 255
        eg: rgb(240, 30. 160) mixing of 3 colors

<img> --> has no closing tag. there fo rit is called as void tags.

APPLYING PNG IMAGES

    To give PNG file effectivley or back ground of png image become transparent 
        <img src="" style="background-color: transparent;">
        some times a shade box may appears, so it can remove by applying border css
CIRCULAR border
    To give circular border make a square of width and height
    then apply border-radius as half of height  or width
